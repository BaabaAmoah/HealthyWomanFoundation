    <!-- Preamble to the topic of discuss. -->
    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p> The feminine gender in recent times has been open to several medical
        conditions unlike in the 80's. The awareness of these conditions are
        minimal therby leaving the vast majority of thepatients at greater risk.
        This is because the underlying effect would have spread deep into the 
        tissues and in most cases, absolutely dificult to manage. At Healthy Women
        Foundation, we seek to eradicate ignorance on certain health issues
        affecting women.

<!-- Explaining Cervical Cancer. -->
    <h3>WHAT CERVICAL CANCER IS.</h3>
        Cervical cancer is also known as cancer of the cervix and that pretty much
        sums up what it is. It begins on the surface of one's cervix and takes
        effect when the cells on the cervix begins to change to pre-cancerous cells.
        It is omportant to note that not all pre-cancerous cells will evolve to cancer.
        However, detecting these problematic cells and treating them before they
        rapidly change is critical to preventing cervical cancer. 

        <!-- What cervix is. -->
       <p> The cervix is the lowest part of a female'e uterus(where a baby grows during pregnancy)
        It has the shape of a donut and connects the uterus to the opening of the vagina.
        It is covered in tissues made up of cells. These healthy cells are what can grow 
        and unfortunately change to precancer cells.</p>

    <h3> COMMON SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF CERVICAL CANCER</h3>
        Quite unfortunately, early stages don't involve symptoms, therfore they are hard to detect.
        The first sign of cervical cancer may take several years to develop. Finding abnormal cells 
        during cervical cancer screening is the best way to avoid cancer of the cervix.
        <p>Some symptoms include;
            (a)Watery/bloody vaginal discharge that may be heavy and jave a foul odour.
            (b)Vaginal bleeding after intercourse, between menstrual periods or after menopause.
            (c)Heavier menstrual periods which lasts longer than normal.
            (d)Painful urination, blood in urine.
            (e)Bleeding from rectum when passing out stool.
            (f)Pelvic/abdominal pain....etc

        <h3>CAUSES</h3>
        Most cervical cancers are caused by the virus HPV(a sexually transmitted infection). HPV 
        spreads through sexual contact (anal, oral and vaginal). Early detection of HPV, done via regular
        screening can help identify cell changes before they become cancerous. The HPV vaccine helps
        prevent HPV infection.

        <h3>DIAGONISING CERVICAL CANCER</h3>
        Regular gynaecological screenings with a pap test can detect most cases. A pap test or pap smear is
        a test that collects cells from your cervix.

        <h3>TREATMENT</h3>
        Depending on the stage, the various treatment available includes surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.

        <h3>THE WAY FORWARD</h3>
        Healthy Women Foundation organizes free screenings every quarter. We take it up and give relief funds to 
        patients as a means to subsidize the cost effectiveness of their treatment. <a href="Click here">Click here</a> to sign up for HWF free screening.
